This is my first blog post.
In this introductory post I would like to share the roadmap of my blog.
Currently I have several projects ongoing. I am a winner of Google's Android Developer Challenge Scholarship on Udacity, so I am enrolled to Udacity Android Nanodegree for free. I plan to share my thougts and codes during this project.
I am also a student of Udacity Delf Driving Car Nanodegree, I also plan to share my codes and my learning adventure with Udacity.
Additionally I am as a hobbyist of Deep Learning Türkiye, leading a learning community towards completition of Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization and currently we are focused on Convolutional Neural Networks Lecture, I plan to prepare a guideline for my friends both in Turkish and English.
Apart from online learning, I plan to share moments of joys and struggles of my PhD research too!
Wish me luck and
kind regards from Neuroscitechie ❤️
